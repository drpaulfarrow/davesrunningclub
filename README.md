# Dave's Running Club

A memorial website honouring our dear friend Dave Reynolds, who found joy and peace in running. This running club was founded to remember him, support each other, and raise awareness about mental health.

## ðŸ’™ In Memory of Dave Reynolds

This website serves as a tribute to Dave Reynolds, who tragically lost his life to suicide. We honour his memory by continuing his love of running and building a supportive community that promotes mental health awareness.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Tribute to Dave with mental health awareness messaging
- **Schedule**: Upcoming runs that honour Dave's memory
- **Members**: Community of runners who carry on Dave's legacy
- **Gallery**: Photos of our running club members and activities
- **Contact**: Get in touch to join our community
- **Add Your Run**: Share your runs and contribute to the club's total distance

## Architecture

This is a full-stack application with:
- **Frontend**: React.js with modern styling
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API
- **Data Storage**: JSON file (simple, no database required)
- **Real-time Updates**: All users see the same running data

## Mental Health Resources
